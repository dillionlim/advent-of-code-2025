# Advent of Code 2025 Solutions
---

These are my solutions for Advent of Code 2025, written in C++.

The main aim is for me to get more familiar with C++, and also try to solve each problem as computationally efficiently as possible, hence leading to some perhaps extreme solutions (e.g. digit DP for day 2).
